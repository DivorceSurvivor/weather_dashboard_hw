This application uses [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to get weather information for different cities.
You can search any city to get current weather information as well as a 5-day forecast for that city using this application. You can see various information such as Temperature, Wind speed, Humidity and UV Index. UV Index is also provided with different colors (green, yellow, orange, red and violet) to indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
This application stores your search history locally. When you click on a city in the search history, then you are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
